# CSS filter: blur() Inconsistency and Unexpected Behavior
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the CSS `filter: blur()` property. In some situations, particularly with older browsers or when combined with other properties like `transform` or `opacity`, the blur effect might not function as expected.

The `bug.css` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a possible solution or workaround.  The issue centers around inconsistencies in browser rendering and potential interactions between CSS properties that affect the visual outcome of the blur effect.

This repository serves as a reference and learning resource for understanding and addressing such inconsistencies when using CSS filters.
